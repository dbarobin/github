Visual Studio Code Dev Containers

The Dev Containers extension lets you use a Docker container as a full-featured development environment. Whether you deploy to containers or not, containers make a great development environment because you can:

Develop with a consistent, easily reproducible toolchain on the same operating system you deploy to.
Quickly swap between different, separate development environments and safely make updates without worrying about impacting your local machine.
Make it easy for new team members / contributors to get up and running in a consistent development environment.
Try out new technologies or clone a copy of a code base without impacting your local setup.
The extension starts (or attaches to) a development container running a well defined tool and runtime stack. Workspace files can be mounted into the container from the local file system, or copied or cloned into it once the container is running. Extensions are installed and run inside the container where they have full access to the tools, platform, and file system.

You then work with VS Code as if everything were running locally on your machine, except now they are separated inside a container.

Dev Container

System Requirements

You can use Docker with the Dev Containers extension in a few ways, including:

Docker installed locally
Docker installed on a remote environment
Other Docker compliant CLIs, installed locally or remotely
While other CLIs may work, they are not officially supported. Note that attaching to a Kubernetes cluster only requires a properly configured kubectl CLI
You can learn more in the alternative Docker options doc.

Below are some specific ways you can configure Docker.

Local:

Windows: Docker Desktop 2.0+ on Windows 10 Pro/Enterprise. Windows 10 Home (2004+) requires Docker Desktop 2.2+ and the WSL2 back-end. (Docker Toolbox is not supported.)
macOS: Docker Desktop 2.0+.
Linux: Docker CE/EE 18.06+ and Docker Compose 1.21+. (The Ubuntu snap package is not supported.)
Containers:

x86_64 / ARMv7l (AArch32) / ARMv8l (AArch64) Debian 9+, Ubuntu 16.04+, CentOS / RHEL 7+
x86_64 Alpine Linux 3.9+
Other glibc based Linux containers may work if they have needed prerequisites.

While ARMv7l (AArch32), ARMv8l (AArch64), and musl based Alpine Linux support is available, some extensions installed on these devices may not work due to the use of glibc or x86 compiled native code in the extension. See the Remote Development with Linux article for details.

Note that while the Docker CLI is required, the Docker daemon/service does not need to be running locally if you are using a remote Docker host.

Installation

To get started, follow these steps:

Install VS Code or VS Code Insiders and this extension.
Install and configure Docker for your operating system, using one of the paths below or an alternative Docker option, like Docker on a remote host or Docker compliant CLI.

Installation

The recommended way to install GitLab is with the Omnibus packages on our package server. Compared to an installation from source, this is faster and less error prone. Just select your operating system, download the respective package (Debian or RPM) and install it using the system's package manager.

There are various other options to install GitLab, please refer to the installation page on the GitLab website for more information.

Contributing

GitLab is an open source project and we are very happy to accept community contributions. Please refer to Contributing to GitLab page for more details.

Install a development environment

To work on GitLab itself, we recommend setting up your development environment with the GitLab Development Kit. If you do not use the GitLab Development Kit you need to install and configure all the dependencies yourself, this is a lot of work and error prone. One small thing you also have to do when installing it yourself is to copy the example development Puma configuration file:

cp config/puma.example.development.rb config/puma.rb
Instructions on how to start GitLab and how to run the tests can be found in the getting started section of the GitLab Development Kit.

Software stack

GitLab is a Ruby on Rails application that runs on the following software:

Ubuntu/Debian/CentOS/RHEL/OpenSUSE
Ruby (MRI) 3.1.4
Git 2.33+
Redis 6.0+
PostgreSQL 12+
For more information please see the architecture and requirements documentation.

Wikidata Toolkit

Build status Coverage status Maven Central 
 Project Stats

Wikidata Toolkit is a Java library for accessing Wikidata and other Wikibase installations. It can be used to create bots, to perform data extraction tasks (e.g., convert all data in Wikidata to a new format), and to do large-scale analyses that are too complex for using a simple SPARQL query service.

Documentation

Wikidata Toolkit homepage: project homepage with basic user documentation, including guidelines on how to setup your Java IDE for using Maven and git.
Wikidata Toolkit examples: stand-alone Java project that shows how to use Wikidata Toolkit as a library for your own code.

License and Credits

Authors: Markus Kroetzsch, Julian Mendez, Fredo Erxleben, Michael Guenther, Markus Damm, Antonin Delpeuch, Thomas Pellissier Tanon and other contributors

License: Apache 2.0

The development of Wikidata Toolkit has been partially funded by the Wikimedia Foundation under the Wikibase Toolkit Individual Engagement Grant, and by the German Research Foundation (DFG) under Emmy Noether grant KR 4381/1-1 "DIAMOND".

How to make a release

During development, the version number in the pom.xml files should be the next version number assuming that the next version is a patch release, followed by -SNAPSHOT. For instance, if the last version to have been released was 1.2.3, then the pom.xml files should contain <version>1.2.4-SNAPSHOT</version>.

Pick the version number for the new release you want to publish, following SemVer. If this is going to be a patch release, it should be the version currently in pom.xml without the -SNAPSHOT suffix. In the following steps, we will assume this new version is 1.2.4.
Write the new version number in the pom.xml files with mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=1.2.4
Add some release notes in the RELEASE-NOTES.md file at the root of the repository
Commit the changes: git commit -am "Set version to 1.2.4"
Add a tag for the version: git tag -a v1.2.4 -m "Version 1.2.4"
Write the next version number in the pom.xml file, by incrementing the patch release number: mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=1.2.5-SNAPSHOT
Commit the changes: git commit -am "Set version to 1.2.5-SNAPSHOT"
Push commits and tags: git push --tags && git push
In GitHub's UI, create a release by going to https://github.com/Wikidata/Wikidata-Toolkit/releases/new. Pick the tag you just created, give a title to the release and quickly describe the changes since the previous release (see existing releases for examples).
Update the version number mentioned in https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikidata_Toolkit
Update the examples in https://github.com/Wikidata/Wikidata-Toolkit-Examples (generally just bumping WDTK's version in the pom.xml file works. Make sure it still compiles afterwards.)
The library is automatically packaged and uploaded to Maven Central by the continuous deployment (with GitHub Actions). So is the HTML version of the javadoc (to GitHub Pages).

Display a sponsor button
Displaying a sponsor button in your repository

You can add a sponsor button in your repository to increase the visibility of funding options for your open source project.

About FUNDING files

You can configure your sponsor button by editing a FUNDING.yml file in your repository's .github folder, on the default branch. You can configure the button to include sponsored developers in GitHub Sponsors, external funding platforms, or a custom funding URL. For more information about GitHub Sponsors, see "About GitHub Sponsors."

You can add one username, package name, or project name per external funding platform and up to four custom URLs. You can add one organization and up to four sponsored developers in GitHub Sponsors. Add each platform on a new line, using the following syntax.

Platform	Syntax
LFX Mentorship (formerly CommunityBridge)	community_bridge: PROJECT-NAME
GitHub Sponsors	github: USERNAME or github: [USERNAME, USERNAME, USERNAME, USERNAME]
IssueHunt	issuehunt: USERNAME
Ko-fi	ko_fi: USERNAME
Liberapay	liberapay: USERNAME
Open Collective	open_collective: USERNAME
Patreon	patreon: USERNAME
Tidelift	tidelift: PLATFORM-NAME/PACKAGE-NAME
Polar	polar: USERNAME
Custom URL	custom: LINK1 or custom: [LINK1, LINK2, LINK3, LINK4]
For Tidelift, use the platform-name/package-name syntax with the following platform names.

Language	Platform name
JavaScript	npm
Python	pypi
Ruby	rubygems
Java	maven
PHP	packagist
C#	nuget
Here's an example FUNDING.yml file:

github: [octocat, surftocat]
patreon: octocat
tidelift: npm/octo-package
custom: ["https://www.paypal.me/octocat", octocat.com]
Note: If a custom URL in an array includes :, you must wrap the URL in quotes. For example, "https://www.paypal.me/octocat".

You can create a default sponsor button for your organization or personal account. For more information, see "Creating a default community health file."

Funding links provide a way for open source projects to receive direct financial support from their community. We don’t support the use of funding links for other purposes, such as for advertising, or supporting political, community, or charity groups. If you have questions about whether your intended use is supported, please visit GitHub Support.

Displaying a sponsor button in your repository

Anyone with admin permissions can enable a sponsor button in a repository.

On GitHub.com, navigate to the main page of the repository.

Under your repository name, click  Settings. If you cannot see the "Settings" tab, select the  dropdown menu, then click Settings.

Screenshot of a repository header showing the tabs. The "Settings" tab is highlighted by a dark orange outline.

On the "General" settings page, in the "Features" section, select Sponsorships.

In the "Sponsorships" box, click Set up sponsor button or Override funding links.

In the file editor, follow the instructions in the FUNDING.yml file to add links to your funding locations.

Click Commit changes...

In the "Commit message" field, type a short, meaningful commit message that describes the change you made to the file. You can attribute the commit to more than one author in the commit message. For more information, see "Creating a commit with multiple authors."

Below the commit message fields, decide whether to add your commit to the current branch or to a new branch. If your current branch is the default branch, you should choose to create a new branch for your commit and then create a pull request. For more information, see "Creating a pull request."

Screenshot of a GitHub pull request showing a radio button to commit directly to the main branch or to create a new branch. New branch is selected.

Click Commit changes or Propose changes.

 DPA Attachment 4
ANNEX IV to the Standard Contractual Clauses (EU/EEA) Additional Safeguards Addendum
This Addendum to the Standard Contractual Clauses (“Addendum”) by GitHub provides extra safeguards and redress for data subjects linked to Customer's personal data. It supplements but does not modify the Standard Contractual Clauses.
I. Challenges to Orders: If GitHub receives an order demanding disclosure of personal data transferred under the Standard Contractual Clauses, GitHub will:
a. Redirect the third party to request data from the Customer;
b. Inform the Customer unless legally prohibited, striving to waive this prohibition;
c. Challenge the disclosure order legally.
II. Indemnification of Data Subjects: GitHub shall indemnify a data subject for damages caused by GitHub's disclosure of their data in response to an order from a non-EU/EEA government body.
a. No Obligation to Indemnify:
i. If the data subject has already received compensation for the same damage,
GitHub has no obligation to indemnify.
ii. If GitHub can prove the disclosure did not violate Chapter V of the GDPR,
GitHub has no obligation to indemnify.
b. Conditions of Indemnification: Indemnification depends on the data subject proving
that:
i. GitHub disclosed the data;
ii. This led to an official proceeding against them; and
iii. The disclosure directly caused damage.
c. Scope of Damages: Indemnification covers only damages defined in the GDPR, excluding consequential and other damages not due to GitHub’s GDPR infringement.
III. Exercise of Rights: Data subjects can enforce their rights under this Addendum against GitHub irrespective of any restrictions in the Standard Contractual Clauses. Claims must be individual, not part of a collective action, and are non-transferable.
IV. Notice of Change: GitHub warrants that the current legislation to which it is subject allows it to fulfill obligations under this Addendum and the Standard Contractual Clauses. If a legal change affecting these obligations occurs, GitHub will notify the Customer, who can then suspend data transfer or terminate the contract.
V. Termination: This Addendum ends if a different lawful transfer mechanism is approved that covers the data transfers of the Standard Contractual Clauses, and doesn't require these additional safeguards.
